1. Stacks are LIFO(last in first out), while Queues follow a FIFO(first in first out) order of operations. 

2. The retrevial time complexity for the following data structures are ascending. 
Linked lists have the smallest amount of complexity at o(n) - or linear time. 
Hashtables are slightly slowly with operations completing in o(1)- constant time. 
Meanwhile Binary Search Trees are the slowest with 0(log(n)) logarithimic time complexity, this type of data structure will find it difficult to scale.

3. Some advatanges include the ability to resize buckets to avoid one bucket getting too large, as well as faster data retrieval.
